I just did the data modelling and data engineering parts of this challenge.  I was unable to do the data analysis part because for the first couple of tables I tried uploading into,
I kept getting an error message in which I was apparently trying to get char(4) values into a char(1) column.  There seem to be some additional constraints on this database the nature of which I don't understand.  I spent two days and nights trying to figure it out before giving up.  I hope the schema and the .pdf and .png ERD files are okay.
